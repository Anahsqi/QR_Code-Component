## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I gained a better understanding of responsive design and how to efficiently use Flexbox for layout management. I also learned more about structuring clean and maintainable CSS using custom properties.

Here is a code snippet Iâ€™m particularly proud of:

```css
body{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    background-color: rgb(214, 226, 240) ;
    font-family: Outfit, sans-serif;
}

```


### Continued development
In future projects, I plan to continue focusing on:

Mastering responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid
Optimizing CSS for better performance
Enhancing web accessibility and making websites more inclusive
